# Hey there, I’m Pablo! 👋  

I’m a **web developer**, **UI/UX designer**, and **former CEO** of a branding and marketing agency. With over a decade of experience, I’ve evolved from building bespoke WordPress websites to creating modern, scalable applications using **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **AWS**.  

### 🚀 My Journey  
From designing small business websites to crafting enterprise-grade solutions, I’ve lived through the evolution of web development. My journey started with WordPress—experimenting, breaking things, and eventually mastering it. Now, I’m focused on building sleek, scalable apps while bringing a designer’s eye for detail to every line of code.

### 🛠 What I’m Building  
I’m currently leading **Lasting Memories**, a platform where storytelling meets technology. It’s a space to preserve legacies and celebrate life through timeless digital memorials. Think innovation meets empathy.

### 🔧 My Tools of Choice  
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js, REST APIs  
- **Cloud**: AWS (Amplify, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront)  
- **Design**: Figma, Adobe XD, and a touch of caffeine-fueled creativity  

### 🌟 Why I Do This  
I believe great design and robust technology aren’t just tools—they’re bridges that connect people, tell stories, and solve problems. Whether it’s simplifying complex ideas or creating platforms that matter, I’m always up for a challenge.  

### ✉️ Let’s Collaborate!  
I’m always excited to hear about projects that push boundaries. Reach out, and let’s create something extraordinary together!
